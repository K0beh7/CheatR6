AMDPrivacyOverlay

Requirements
- **AMD Privacy View:** This software can only be downloaded via the Radeon Software, which isn't available on Nvidia systems. To simplify, I've included a [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mPP4KVVfqv0-P2t-zvY4ZShmcpu3YULE/view) with a RAR file containing the executable.
- **Camera Setup:** Set up Privacy View using your own camera or download ManyCam Virtual Camera.

### Instructions
1 **Compile** the DLL.
2 **Inject** the DLL into the Privacy View executable (use your preferred method).
3  just **run it as an executable**â€”whichever works best for you!
