# AMDPrivacyOverlay

Leverage AMD's Privacy View software to render your cheat.

### Overview
This project utilizes AMD's Privacy View, a unique approach to rendering overlays. While it's a method similar to other overlays, using this specific class/window is rare—so here's a fresh take on it!

### Requirements
- **AMD Privacy View:** This software can only be downloaded via the Radeon Software, which isn't available on Nvidia systems. To simplify, I've included a [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mPP4KVVfqv0-P2t-zvY4ZShmcpu3YULE/view) with a RAR file containing the executable.
- **Camera Setup:** Set up Privacy View using your own camera or download ManyCam Virtual Camera. Calibration can be skipped.

### Instructions
1. **Compile** the DLL.
2. **Inject** the DLL into the Privacy View executable (use your preferred method).
3. Alternatively, just **run it as an executable**—whichever works best for you!
