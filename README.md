# AMDPrivacyOverlay
Using AMDs Privacy View software to render our cheat.


Its the same method as any other overlay but i have seen noone using this method yet so here ya go:

Download and compile but since AMD Privacy View can only be downloaded through the Radeon software ive attached a rar file containing the exe. (yes this works lmfao)

youll need a usb camera or just use manycam and setup the PrivacyView.

Compile the dll and inject it into the privacy view exe (idc how) and wow amazing overlay!
