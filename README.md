# AMDPrivacyOverlay
Using AMDs Privacy View software to render our cheat.

Its the same method as any other overlay but I have seen no one using this class/window yet so here ya go:

Download and compile but since AMD Privacy View can only be downloaded through the Radeon software (Which is not available on Nvidia systems) I've attached a google drive link on the GitHub read me with a RAR file containing the exe. (yes this works lmfao)
Youll need to actually setup the privacy view so just use your own camera or download ManyCam Virtual Camera. You can skip the calibration step as its not needed.
Compile the dll and inject it into the privacy view exe (idc how) and wow amazing overlay! (or just run as an exe i guess...)
